# HerbivoryToleranceModel
A mathematical simulation model that captures effect of abovegground herbivory on belowground storage in pernnial plants. The populationmodel is based on three state variables Aboveground biomass, Stored belowground biomass, and Herbivore population. Model results and theoretical implications of the study is published in Thomas et al. Theoretical Ecology, 2017: 35-50.
